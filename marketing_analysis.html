			<h3><p>According to our Marketing Analysis and our projections, we will in total, have a starting client base of about 35 million, 1.94 million of which need catering services. From those 1.94 million clients, we have calculated that about 49,700 would buy our product. Around 45,500 clients would be businesses, and approximately 4,200 would be schools. These are our main target audiences.</p>

			<p>Each client will be expected to purchase a different amount of DERFLA bots each time, so we calculated this number as well, to estimate the amount of bots we would need to supply for these clients. The businesses being catering services and restaurants would need around 4 robots each. People who need it for special occasions need 2 to 3 robots, depending on attendance size. Private schools, having more money to use, would purchase around 2 robots. Public schools that have a more limited budget would purchase 1 to 2 bots. In total, the amount of bots we have to produce for clients is 187,890 (maximum amount).</p></h3>
